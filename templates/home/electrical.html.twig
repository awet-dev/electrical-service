            <p>Older homes often require electrical service upgrades to deal with the increased demand of new appliances or additional electrical requirements that result from renovations. Sometimes a simple electrical panel upgrade is all that is needed but more often than not, your meter socket and grounding system require additional work.</p>
            <p>As upgrading your electrical power for a renovation project requires several steps you need an experienced team to make sure the work is done correctly.</p>
            <p>The good news is this: You only have to make one call and Stapleton Electric does all the rest! We have been performing service upgrades for almost 20 years and we can help you every step of the way.</p>
            <p>The project start with an initial site meeting between our team, the contractor and the homeowner. (If you donâ€™t have a contractor we can recommend one.)</p>
            <p>We contact BC hydro on you behalf to discuss everything required for a successful electrical panel upgrade.</p>
